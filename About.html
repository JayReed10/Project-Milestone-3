    <h1>Summary About Myself</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
        I am 23 years old with a beautiful wife and dog. I have lived in Douglasville for the past 4 months. My ultimate goal at Kennesaw State is to graduate with my degree in IT and a minor in Software Engineering. Post graduation I will pursue jobs within the field with hopes to land a job at my current employer.

        Throughout my professional career, I have worked in various jobs in many diverse positions that have shaped my character today. I began in 2017 at my first Job working as a cashier at Target. I would later spend the next 7 years working there where I have held a series of management positions and experienced things that I never thought I would have the opportunity to. I really enjoyed my time working at Target.

        Today, I have transitioned into a new role at McMaster-Carr supply company. This role consists of supporting our customers and resolving any issues with their experience with working with our company. I truly enjoy this role as it gives a very wide range of daily experience.
