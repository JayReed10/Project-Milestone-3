    <h1>Hello everyone, I am Jalyn Reed</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
        I have attended Kennesaw State University for 4 years. I am now entering my senior year which is very exciting times for me. During my sophomore year I decided to change my major from Chemistry to Information Technology. This has been one of the best decisions I have made ever. I really enjoy this program and look forward to a great career.
